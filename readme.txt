# Setup
## Installing coXpress:
From https://sourceforge.net/projects/coxpress/files/coxpress/R%203.0/ , download coXpress_1.5.tar.gz (the tar file, not the zip file). 
RStudio > Tools > Install Packages... > select "Install from: Package Archive File (.zip; .tar.gz) > select the tar file.
Since coXpress was last updated in 2013, it has to be rebuilt from the tar file in order to run in modern versions of R.

## Installing WGCNA:
RStudio > Tools > Install Packages... > select "Install from: Repository (CRAN)" and type WGCNA in the text box below
